# How to create a local repo in git and upload to Github
## Instructions for creating a local repository

* I used mkdir insided a tmp dir to create the repo name
* I used git init to generate the git directory
* I created a local README.md file with vim to commit and push
* Note: Had to create a repository inside Github first
* I did not create a README.md file at creation of repo in Github because I will upload one
* I used git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new_repo_name
* Then git push -u origin master  (not certain yet what the -u flag does)

These actions pushed a README.md file into my new repo on Github.com
